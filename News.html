        <h1><u>How to mining Crypto</u></h1>
        <h3>Mining</h3>
        <center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/672JlTIQ4RU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
        <p>In cryptocurrency networks, mining is a validation of transactions. For this effort, successful miners 
            obtain new cryptocurrency as a reward. The reward decreases transaction fees by creating a complementary
             incentive to contribute to the processing power of the network. The rate of generating hashes, which validate any 
             transaction, has been increased by the use of specialized machines such as FPGAs and ASICs running complex hashing
              algorithms like SHA-256 and scrypt. This arms race for cheaper-yet-efficient machines has existed since Bitcoin was 
              introduced in 2009.[57]</p>

          <p> With more people venturing into the world of virtual currency, generating hashes for validation has become more 
              complex over time, forcing miners to invest increasingly large sums of money to improve computing performance. 
              Consequently, the reward for finding a hash has diminished and often does not justify the investment in equipment 
              and cooling facilities (to mitigate the heat the equipment produces), and the electricity required to run them. 
              Popular regions for mining include those with inexpensive electricity, a cold climate, and jurisdictions with clear and
               conducive regulations. By July 2019, Bitcoin's electricity consumption was estimated to be approximately 7 gigawatts, 
               around 0.2% of the global total, or equivalent to the energy consumed nationally by Switzerland.</p>
            
         <p>   Some miners pool resources, sharing their processing power over a network to split the reward equally, 
             according to the amount of work they contributed to the probability of finding a block. A "share" is awarded to members of
              the mining pool who present a valid partial proof-of-work.</p>
            
          <p>  As of February 2018, the Chinese Government has halted trading of virtual currency, banned initial coin 
              offerings and shut down mining. Many Chinese miners have since relocated to Canada and Texas.[61] One company 
              is operating data centers for mining operations at Canadian oil and gas field sites, due to low gas prices. In June 2018
              , Hydro Quebec proposed to the provincial government to allocate 500 Megawatts of power to crypto companies for mining.
              According to a February 2018 report from Fortune, Iceland has become a haven for cryptocurrency miners in part because of its cheap
               electricity.</p>
            
          <p>  In March 2018, the city of Plattsburgh in upstate New York put an 18-month moratorium on all cryptocurrency mining in an effort to
               preserve natural resources and the "character and direction"
               of the city. As of February 2022, Kazakhstan became the second-biggest crypto-currency mining country, producing 18.1% of the
                global hash rate. The country has
                built a compound containing 50,000 computers near Ekibastuz.</p>

        <h3>GPU Price Rise</h3>   
        <center><img src="https://imgsrv2.voi.id/xxEzBVXwVD-ueCJDnLuzyquNF0OJ5DXyHoUVKdRrtZM/auto/1200/675/sm/1/bG9jYWw6Ly8vcHVibGlzaGVycy8xMDMzMzgvMjAyMTExMTExODAwLW1haW4ucG5n.jpg"style="width: 560px; height:360px;"/></center>
        <p>
            An increase in cryptocurrency mining increased the demand for graphics cards (GPU) in 2017. 
            (The computing power of GPUs makes them well-suited to generating hashes.) Popular favorites of cryptocurrency miners 
            such as Nvidia's GTX 1060 and GTX 1070 graphics cards, as well as AMD's RX 570 and RX 580 GPUs, doubled or tripled in
             price – or were out of stock. A GTX 1070 Ti which was released at a price of $450 sold for as much as $1100. 
             Another popular card, the GTX 1060 (6 GB model) was released at an MSRP of $250, and sold for almost $500. RX 570
              and RX 580 cards from AMD were out of stock for almost a year. Miners regularly buy up the entire stock of new GPU's as
               soon as they are available.</p>

        <p>
              Nvidia has asked retailers to do what they can when it comes to selling GPUs to gamers instead of miners.
               "Gamers come first for Nvidia," said Boris Böhles, PR manager for Nvidia in the German region.

        <h3>
            What is Blockchain and how does it work ? 
        </h3>
        <p>In the instance of cryptocurrencies this is where Blockchain comes in. 
            Blockchain is a public ledger of all transactions that have ever happened within a network, 
            available to everyone. This means that everyone in the network can see every account’s balance, allowing the 
            digital currency to operate independently of a central bank. In order for a cryptocurrency network to work,
             all participants must be in agreement about the legitimacy of balances and transactions.</p>
        <h3>
            Blockchain in healthcare
        </h3>   
        <p>There are many ways blockchain technology can improve the design and deployment of 
            European Electronic Health Records. For example, blockchain can improve the security of patients records,
             store consent – reducing administrative burden- and optimise the nursing profession.
